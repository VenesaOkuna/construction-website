    <div class="testimony"> <p> "We have had a very good experience with Taylor Lane, with great service from start to finish. We especially enjoyed the tour of the professional factory."
      <br>
        Ryan Davies, Owner, Llanerch</p></div>
     <div class="testimony"><p>"Taylor Lane were key to the design process. They do all the engineering calculations...and tell you if something’s possible or not, calculate the truss requirements etc. "
      <br>
        Mark Young, Self-builder</p></div>
     <div class="testimony"><p>"We have a long history with Taylor Lane. They have worked with Lovell and been part of our supply chain for well over 15 years, that I know to. When I have visited Hereford (on a number of occasions), it’s a welcoming business that’s open, honest and transparent on all matters commercial, design, technical. We quickly derived confidence that they were the right choice for us...and that’s been vindicated by performance onsite thereafter."
     <br>
        John Leary, Major Projects Director, Lovell</p></div>
     <div class="testimony"><p>"We had worked with them [Taylor Lane] previously and were happy to continue that relationship knowing the quality of the frame and the service that we would receive."
